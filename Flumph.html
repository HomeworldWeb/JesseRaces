            Flumphs generally live in small communities called cloisters in the underdark, and often help adventurers by telling them about evil creatures. A flumph may feel out of place among their own kind, and join a party of adventurers on a quest instead of just helping them once. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Flumphs do not have a biological sex, and they do not generally have names, but they may adopt a name and gender when interacting with other races who have them. <br>
