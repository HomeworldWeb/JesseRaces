            Faerie Dragons are natural tricksters and almost always cheerful. Although they normally have lairs and territories to stick to, a faerie dragon is not very powerful and may be ousted by a competitor. Such a faerie dragon may join a group of adventurers and even become one itself. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Faerie dragons are not given names at birth, but they might chose one later on based solely on whim, with no distinction between male and female names. <br>

          <p style="margin-left:-10px"><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Ability Score Change. </span>Your Strength score decreases by 3, to a minimum of 1, and you either increase one ability score by 2 and one other by 1, or increase three ability scores by 1. For a classic faerie dragon, you would increase Charisma by 2 and Inteligence by 1 using that. You also either increase your Dexterity by 5, or increase one ability score by 2 and one other by 1, or increase three ability scores by 1. Your Dexterity maximum is increased to 23. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Age. </span> A Faerie dragon changes color as it ages, and reages biological maturity by age 5, but often never reach "psychological maturity". Faerie dragons have innate spellcasting, and learn more spells as they age, as detailed  below. It is unknown how long a faerie dragon can live, although it is probably more than 1,000 years. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Alignment. </span>Alomst all faerie dragons are chaotic due to their pranks, and many are good. There are, however, a few evil faerie dragons who are ussually delusional and/or just take their jokes too far. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Size. </span>Faerie dragons are about the size of a cat, and have slender bodies with large wings. Your size is Tiny. Because of this, your hit dice have 2 less sides than they normally would for your class, and at level 1, you have 2 less hit points than you normally would. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Speed. </span>Your base walking speed is 10 feet, and you have a base flying speed of 60 feet. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Type. </span>You are a Dragon. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Bite. </span>Your unarmed strike does piercing damage. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Darkvision. </span>You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colors in darkness, only shades of gray. <br><span class="trait">  &nbsp; &nbsp; Different Anatomy. </span>You cannot wear armor unless it was custom made for your anatomy, and any armor you start with is. You also may not be able to attune to some magic items, at the DM's discression. <br><span class="trait">  &nbsp; &nbsp; Euphoria Breath. </span>You exhale a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier, or for 1 minute, the target can't take any kind of action and must roll a d6 at the start of each of it's turns to determine its behavior during the turn: <br>1-4: The target does nothing except use all of it's movement to move in a random direction. <br>5-6: The target does nothing except repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Four-Legged Walking. </span>You cannot hold anything with two hands while walking, nor can you attack using two hands if you are on the ground. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Innate Spellcasting. </span> This table has the color that corresponds to each age of Faerie Dragon as well as the spells a Faerie Dragon of that age would know. You can cast each spell of your age or of one corresponding to a younger age one time without out any components or a spell slot, and charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You cannot cast a spell with this trait thats spell level is greater than half your character level. </p>
