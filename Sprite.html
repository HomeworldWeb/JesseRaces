            Sprites live in thick forests and in the feywild, and although they will viciously defend against evil near their home, they may not want to leave it. Some sprites, however, would leap at the opportunity to pursue and go on the offensive against evil.  <br>

          <p style="margin-left:-10px"><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Ability Score Change. </span>Your Strength decreases by 3, to a minimum of 1, and you either increase one ability score by 2 and one other by 1, or increase three ability scores by 1. A classic sprite would increase Inteligence by 2 and Wisdom by 1. You also either increase your Dexterity by 4, or you either increase one ability score by 2 and one other by 1, or increase three ability scores by 1. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Age. </span>Although information is hazy at best, Sprites seem to reach maturity at around 10 years old, and seem to live for around 300 years. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Alignment. </span>Sprites are usually neutral good, fiercly fighting evil that appears among them. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Size. </span>Sprites look like Tiny Humanoids with dragonfly wings. Your size is Tiny. Because of this, your hit dice have 2 less sides than they normally would for your class, and at level 1, you have 2 less hit points than you normally would. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Speed.</span> Your base walking speed is 10 feet, and you have a base flying speed of 40 feet. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Type.</span>You are a Fey. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Bonus Proficiencies. </span>You have proficiency in Perception and Stealth. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Heart Sight. </span>You touch a creature and magically know its current emotional state. If the target fails a saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier, you also learn the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Invisibility. </span>You magically turn invisible until you attack or cast a spell, or until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any eqipment you are wearing turns invisible with you. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Tiny Gear. </span>You cannot wear armor unless it was custom madefor some-one your size and shape. You can commission armor to be made for you to a jeweler, who may be more equiped to make metal armor for you, a doll maker for light armor, or an armor smith of a similarly sized race. You also may not be able to attune to some magic items, at the DM's discretion. You cannot use any normal weapons except a pre-loaded crossbow. However, similar to with armor, you can have tiny weapons made that you can weild that do 1 damage on hit regardless of your ability modifier unless using a modifier aside from Strength or Dexterity. Also, when weilding these tiny weapons, count the damage die as a d1 for critical hits, and you score a critical hit on the next two rolls on the d20 below your normal critical hit rolls, so normally 18 and 19. Your unarmed strike does no damage. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Tiny Hiding. </span>You can hide behing objects and creatures only one size bigger than you with no penalties, and you can hide behind some tiny creatures and objects, at the DM's discretion, although Wisdom(perception) checks made to search for you have advantage, and when making a general scan of the room or area, the total needed to find you would be lower, the degree of which determined by the DM. <br><span class="trait"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Languages. </span>You know Common, Elven, and Sylvan</p>
